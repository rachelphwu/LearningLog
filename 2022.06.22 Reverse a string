###Reflective : How do you describe your emotions? 

Got another puzzle solved! 


###Interpretive : What did we learn today?

1. Test out a small function before setting the for loop 
2. arr.slice(-1) - cut and store item(-1)     VS      arr.splice(-1) delete an item(-1)
3. arr.splice(toindex, remove, item)
4. arr.pop - remove the last item
5. str > process > str: 
   - arr = str.split
   - join = arr.join("")
   - text = join.toString()
   - console.log(text)
   
 6. Alternative way: 
 
 

#What is an important

1. Splice doesn't store the removed item 

#How to describe today's progress with one sentence? 

1. Don't give up ;) 

#What are the things we need to keep working on tomorrow? 

1. New ex.
