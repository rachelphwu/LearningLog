###Objective 

What do you remember from today's course?

From my notes, I've learnt

= is to give value to a variable, not make it equal

== 1 '1' > T 
=== 1, '1' > F (*Type)


###Reflective 

How do you describe your emotions?

Frustrated because it's been 10 days I didn't do anything on coding due to freelance work. 
It seems that I might have forgotten something...


###Interpretive 

What did we learn today?


#Types 
obj: {a:1}
string: "30" hello
underfined 
function

-----

#Array

var score = [1,3,5]
score.push(1000)
score[3]>1000
console.log(score[score.length-1])>1000

#avoid decimal
