###Reflective : How do you describe your emotions? 

Excited


###Interpretive : What did we learn today?

1. SIMPLIFY A FUNCTION WITH SMALL FUNCTIONS 

eg. To create a function that can print out all 9x9 multiplication tables

Step 1: Create a small function(n) to print out n x 1 until n x 9  
Step 2: Create a function n = i, n++ 
Step 3: Combine! 

2. DON'T DOUBLE 
If the first function has console.log, don't do it again in the next function 


function table(n){
for(var i=1; i<10; i++){
 console.log( n + "*" + i + "=" + n*i)}
 }

function table9to9(){
 for(var t=1; t<10; t++){
 table(t)}                               <<<< No need to console.log again
  }

table9to9()



#What is an important realization? 



#How to describe today's progress with one sentence? 


#What are the things we need to keep working on tomorrow?
