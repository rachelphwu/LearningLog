###Objective 

- What do you remember from today's course? - 

We're were learning about loops and funcitons 

###Reflective 

- How do you describe your emotions? - 

a little bored ... because I've learnt these basic concepts on Codecademy.
But I feel that the way the teacher explained it in detail is also great for setting a foundation.


###Interpretive 

- What did we learn today? -

- To create a loop, you need an initial value, end conditions and the activity to be done in each loop.
- You can set a function with variable or start with a function directly?
- function is a type and you can use it directly?
- Always start with a framework, then fill in things. For problems you don't know how to solve now, separate it in another block.


- What is an important realization? -

There are usually many ways to initiate one action. eg. (do while, for while, goto label)


- How to describe today's progress with one sentence? -
Good

- What are the things we need to keep working on tomorrow? - 
Complete all video courses and start the exercise.
