###Objective 客觀

關於今天的課程，你記得什麼？

This entry is a summary for what I've done last week.
I've been doing the homework, until the final task where I got stuck. 

###Reflective 感受

你要如何形容今天的情緒

Got really excited about making my first program run! 
The shell script that can add as many files as the number you type in the program, with the file names going in chronological order.

Then I also attempted the final task---to create a program that will link to a website and extract certain lines of information.
Here I'm getting stuck.


###Interpretive 解釋反思

我們今天學到了什麼？

- I could feel the satisfaction of completing sth with code. 
- That google sometimes don't get you a direct answer... I might need to learn how to break down my problems/ wish and google each item one by one. I need to work on it.

今天一個重要的領悟是什麼？
I need to find a more systemic way to make guesses. 
I need to know how to google "correctly" 

我們會如何用一句話形容今天的工作？ 
I worked hard last week! 

有哪些工作需要明天繼續努力? 
Work on the final task and get week 2 started asap.
