###Objective 客觀

關於今天的課程，你記得什麼？

I'm close to completing a task that I wasn't able to last week... I almost gave up but I didn't.


###Reflective 感受

你要如何形容今天的情緒
Surprised to see when something is finally working...


###Interpretive 解釋反思

我們今天學到了什麼？

1. Undo in vim: esc + u 

2. Curl:transfer data from a server (eg. website) --> Curl -s -L 
-s	偵測該檔名是否存在且為『非空白檔案』？
-L	該『檔名』是否存在且為一個連結檔？

            curl -s -L https://api.github.com/users/${user} | grep -E 'login|bio|location|url' | cut -d ':' -f2 

3. Grep: grep -1 (with space)
-e	該『檔名』是否存在？(常用)
- use grep & cut after sth with | (with space)
- grep multiple strings with | (no space, under same quotation)

4. Sed: useful for deleting sth 


Questions:

- Tried to put the link as variable but it doesn't work. Why?
           
           link= xxxx

- Is there difference between -E and -e? 

- What are the differences between Grep & Awk?

今天一個重要的領悟是什麼？

*** Test each step chronologically instead of trying the whole chunk. Make progress with one small step at a time.
*** Don't give up...

我們會如何用一句話形容今天的工作？  

Rest and you will eventually find out the answer 

有哪些工作需要明天繼續努力?
