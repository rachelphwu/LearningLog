###Objective 

- What do you remember from today's course? - 

- There are many built-in functions for number

- How do you describe your emotions? - 

Excited, because I can finally try to write programs.

###Interpretive 

- What did we learn today? -

- To debug: console.log
- "return" signifies the last action of a function. Whatever written after will be neglected.
- Functions for numbers including: 
  rounding up/down/off, [ceil/floor/round] // getting integers or decimal place // random no. // from number to string // from string to number
 - Functions for strings including:
   Lower,upper case// delete space (trim) // replace a word // find a word // charcoal
 - Functions for array, which is an object:
   Array unchanged: join with (eg. ,) // slice
   Array changed: apply functions to all elements (map) // add or delete an element (splice) // sort order //


- What is an important realization? 

Developer.Mozilla.org will help
